## Project
Retirement financial planner. React + Vite. Owner is not a programmer — explain changes simply.

## Critical Rules (check every task)
1. **IRS constants live in `src/config/irs-2026.js` only.** Never hardcode limits, brackets, or thresholds elsewhere.
2. **Portfolio draws use `netPortfolioNeed`** (expenses − SS − pension), never `effectiveExpenses`. This applies to: yearsSustained, withdrawalRate, totalChartData drawdown, optimized scenario. `netPortfolioNeed` must be computed **per-year** in any loop that spans retirement — SS and pension only reduce draws in years they've actually started (see rule 5b).
3. **No double-counting.** `grossAfterTax` (household income − all taxes) is the budget basis. Pre-tax deductions are auto-derived from contributions. For MFJ filers, `grossAfterTax` uses `householdIncome` (primary + spouse); for all other filing statuses it uses primary income only.
4. **Sim-level IRS guards required.** Every contribution in the simulation loop must be independently capped at its IRS limit, regardless of UI constraints.
5. **Dependency order matters.** SS and pension must compute before any drawdown metric that depends on them. If adding a new income source, wire it into `netPortfolioNeed` first.
   - **5b. Income timing.** SS only counts from `ssClaimingAge`; pension only counts from `pensionStartAge`. Any year-by-year loop (drawdown chart, conversion window draws, `retIncomeFloors[]`) must check these ages per iteration — never use the static `netPortfolioNeed` scalar inside a retirement-phase loop.
6. **Financial model = pure functions.** No React state inside `src/model/` files. Inputs in, outputs out, testable without rendering.
7. **Test after every model change.** Run `npm test` before committing any change to `src/model/` or `src/config/`. The suite (147 tests) includes a **golden master** (`src/model/__tests__/golden-master.test.js`) that locks every headline number at the default state — if it fails, a model change moved a value. Update the locked values only when the change was intended.
8. **Hybrid client/server split (pre-launch, not during development).** Model files marked [SERVER] in ARCHITECTURE.md will move behind API routes before launch. During development, import them directly — do NOT set up API routes until feature-complete. See `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`.
9. **MFJ tax calculations use combined household income.** `agi`, `stateTax`, and `grossAfterTax` all include `spouseIncome` when `filingStatus === "mfj"`. FICA is always computed per-earner separately (`Math.min(primaryIncome, FICA_WAGE_BASE) + Math.min(spouseIncome, FICA_WAGE_BASE)`). Contribution limits and account sliders remain per-person (primary earner's accounts only — spouse accounts are a planned premium feature, #30).

## Git & PR Workflow
- **Always use a feature branch.** Never commit directly to `main`.
- **Open a PR before merging.** For any feature, refactor, or substantive change: push the branch, open a PR with a clear title and description explaining what changed and why, then merge. This creates a permanent GitHub record with the full diff.
- **Bug fixes** are the exception — small, contained bug fixes can be committed directly to the feature branch and merged without a formal PR, as long as `docs/BUGS.md` is updated with root cause, files changed, and fix description.
- **`docs/BUGS.md` is the bug record.** Every bug fix must be logged there before merging, whether or not a PR is opened.
- **Test count in `CLAUDE.md` must stay current.** Update the test count in the Commands section whenever new tests are added.

## Status
- Refactored from a 3,988-line monolith into a module structure: pure-function
  model layer (`src/model/`), extracted UI components (`src/components/`),
  constants (`src/config/irs-2026.js`), App.jsx as the state/layout shell.
- Four modeling correctness bugs fixed (Jun 2026):
  1. SS and pension timing in drawdown — per-year `netPortfolioNeed` in all loops
  2. Pension not counted post-`pensionStartAge` when pension starts after retirement
  3. Spouse FICA missing — now computed per-earner
  4. MFJ tax calc incomplete — AGI, state tax, and `grossAfterTax` now use combined household income
- Feature backlog expanded to 48 items including premium tier, household modeling,
  Monte Carlo analytics, and new income sources.
- Three features shipped (Jun 2026):
  1. #8 — Additional pre-tax balances: addlPreTaxBal input feeds RMD and conversion basis
  2. #33 — Bracket-accurate retirement tax: `effectiveRMDTaxRate` from real bracket math
     replaces flat `rate3Combined` proxy for `rmdTaxBite`, `netConversionBenefit`, and
     withdrawal strategy; golden master updated deliberately
  3. Rate3 slider removal: `"Trad 401k"` display now uses `fedMarginal` (bracket-accurate
     working-year rate) computed from actual income/deductions; sliders for phase rates
     removed entirely; TaxTimeline simplified to working/retirement 2-segment view

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm test` — run model + formatter tests (147 tests)
- `npm run build` — production build
- `node .claude/skills/verifier-browser.cjs` — Playwright visual check of all
  three tabs (start dev server on port 5174 first; see the skill's `.md`)
