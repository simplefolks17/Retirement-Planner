# Financial Model

## Tax Calculations

### Federal Income Tax
- **AGI** = grossIncome − totalPreTaxDeduc (where totalPreTaxDeduc = contrib401k + contribHSA + otherPreTaxDeduc)
- **For MFJ filers:** AGI also includes `spouseIncome` (spouse pre-tax deductions are not tracked — planned feature #30). Combined AGI is taxed at MFJ bracket rates, giving the correct joint standard deduction and wider brackets.
- **Taxable income** = AGI − standard deduction (per filing status)
- Applied against 2026 graduated brackets (7 rates: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, 37%)
- Returns both total tax and effective rate (tax / AGI)

### State Income Tax
- Uses a flat effective rate per state from lookup table applied to AGI (which includes spouse income for MFJ)
- User can override with a slider for their actual effective rate
- Retirement state tax uses a separate table — **known limitation:** state exemptions on retirement income (SS, pension, 401k distributions) are not yet modeled per-state. Planned as feature #33.

### FICA
- 7.65% on each earner's gross income independently, each capped at the SS wage base ($168,600 for 2026)
- **For households with spouse income:** `fica = (min(primaryIncome, FICA_WAGE_BASE) + min(spouseIncome, FICA_WAGE_BASE)) × 0.0765`
- FICA uses gross income, not AGI (payroll tax, not income tax)
- **401(k) deferrals do NOT reduce the FICA base** — SS and Medicare apply to gross salary before 401(k) deduction. This is why Box 3/5 on a W-2 is higher than Box 1.
- **HSA via payroll (Section 125 cafeteria plan) DOES reduce the FICA base** — it reduces both Box 1 AND Box 3/5 simultaneously, making it invisible in the Box 1 vs Box 3/5 gap. This is the most tax-efficient way to fund an HSA.

### Household Budget Basis
- `grossAfterTax` = householdIncome − fedTax − stateTax − fica
- `householdIncome` = primaryIncome + spouseIncome (MFJ) or primaryIncome (all other statuses)
- This is the correct budget basis for `savingsCapacity`, `availableSurplus`, and the optimized allocation. It represents household cash available after all taxes are paid.

## HSA Contribution Method

The funding method changes the total tax benefit significantly:

| Method | Federal income tax saved | FICA saved (7.65%) | Total tax saved |
|---|---|---|---|
| Direct contribution (post-paycheck) | Yes — deductible on Schedule 1 | No — FICA already paid | ~22–24% of contribution |
| Payroll deduction via Section 125 | Yes | Yes | ~29–32% of contribution |

### Savings at 22% federal bracket (2026 limits)
- Self-only ($4,300): payroll saves **$1,275** vs direct saves **$946** — $329 difference
- Family ($8,550): payroll saves **$2,535** vs direct saves **$1,881** — $654 difference  
- Family + age 55 catch-up ($9,550): payroll saves **$2,832** vs direct saves **$2,101** — $731 difference

### W-2 reporting implications
- Payroll HSA contributions reduce both Box 1 and Box 3/5, leaving no detectable gap between them
- They should appear in Box 12, Code W — but some employers omit this (reporting error, does not affect tax treatment)
- The contribution is still correctly excluded from taxable wages even if Code W is missing

### Planner modeling rule
- Always ask user whether HSA is funded via payroll or direct deposit
- Apply FICA savings (7.65%) only when method = payroll
- Display coverage type selector (self-only vs family) — family limit is nearly 2× self-only
- Flag HSA as highest tax-efficiency account when user has HDHP coverage (triple tax advantage: pre-tax contributions, tax-free growth, tax-free qualified withdrawals)

### UX — how to ask the HSA question
Most users won't know the term "Section 125" or the difference between payroll deduction and direct contribution. Ask in plain language and default to the most common scenario.

**Recommended UI flow:**
1. Ask: *"Does your HSA contribution come out of your paycheck automatically?"*
   - "Yes, it's deducted from my paycheck" → payroll method (apply FICA savings)
   - "No, I transfer money into it myself" → direct method (no FICA savings)
   - "I'm not sure" → default to payroll method with a note

2. On "I'm not sure": show a friendly explanation:
   *"Most people with employer health coverage have their HSA funded through payroll — it shows up as a deduction on your pay stub alongside taxes and insurance. If that sounds like you, we'll use that method, which gives you the maximum tax savings."*

3. **Never ask**: "Is your HSA a Section 125 cafeteria plan?" — users don't know this and it creates friction without adding value.

4. Ask coverage type separately in plain terms:
   *"Who does your health plan cover?"*
   - "Just me" → self-only limit ($4,300 for 2025)
   - "Me and my family" → family limit ($8,550 for 2025)

### Feature flags to build
- [ ] HSA funding method toggle (payroll vs direct) with "I'm not sure" fallback
- [ ] HSA coverage type selector (self-only vs family)
- [ ] FICA savings line item shown separately in tax breakdown when payroll method is selected
- [ ] Tooltip or explainer that surfaces the ~$329–$654 annual difference between methods so users understand why the question matters

### LTCG (Capital Gains Drag)
- Taxable brokerage growth reduced by LTCG rate each year
- Rate determined from that year's AGI (ordinaryIncome − pre-tax deductions)
- 2026 brackets: 0% / 15% / 20% thresholds per filing status

## Social Security

### AIME (Average Indexed Monthly Earnings)
- Sum earnings for each working year, **capped at FICA wage base** per year
- Divide total by max(workYears, 35) to get average
- Divide by 12 for monthly

### PIA (Primary Insurance Amount)
- Bend points: $1,226 and $7,391 (2026)
- 90% of first $1,226 + 32% of $1,226–$7,391 + 15% above $7,391
- PIA is the monthly benefit at Full Retirement Age (67 for born ≥ 1960)

### Claiming Adjustment
- Age 62: 70% of PIA (permanently reduced)
- Age 67 (FRA): 100% of PIA
- Age 70: 124% of PIA (delayed credits stop here)
- Linear interpolation between these points

### Spousal Benefit
- 50% of the higher earner's PIA (annual = ssPIA × 12 × 0.5)
- Always based on primary's FRA — does NOT increase if the primary delays past FRA
- **Spouse's own claiming age matters (BUG-16 fix, Jun 2026):** if the spouse claims before their own FRA (62–66), the spousal benefit is reduced by the same early-claim factors that apply to any SS claim. Claiming after FRA does NOT increase the spousal benefit (no delayed credits on the spousal component). The spouse receives the higher of their own benefit (adjusted for their claiming age) or the spousal benefit (also adjusted for their claiming age).
- Spouse receives the higher of their own benefit or the spousal amount

### Taxability
- Up to 85% of SS benefit is taxable as ordinary income (used in bracket fill calculations)

## Roth Conversion Model

### Conversion Window (user-adjustable timing)
- The "gap years" between retirement and RMD age (73) are the textbook-optimal window —
  income is lowest before SS, pension, and RMDs stack up. This is the **default** window:
  retirement+1 → `RMD_START_AGE − 1` (age 72).
- **User-adjustable start/stop ages.** `conversionStartAge` / `conversionEndAge` (App state)
  default to `null` = the default window (the golden-master pin). The resolved window is
  clamped to `[safeRetAge+1, RMD_START_AGE−1]`; when `safeRetAge ≥ RMD_START_AGE−1` there is
  no window (`conversionWindowYrs = 0`) and the whole section is suppressed.
- **`buildConversionByAge({ startAge, endAge, … })`** (`retirement-phase.js`) builds the
  engine's `{ [age]: amount }` schedule over the inclusive `[startAge, endAge]` range;
  `annualConversions` is indexed by `age − startAge`. At the default window this is byte-identical
  to the old `safeRetAge+yr+1` indexing.
- Retirement-window conversions run through the single per-account engine
  (`buildRetirementPhase` → `retirement-engine.js`, rule 2b): the principal moves trad→Roth and
  only the tax leaks, stacked bracket-accurately on the SS/pension floor.

### Working-Year Conversions (pre-retirement, sporadic)
- A 401k→Roth conversion can also happen in a low-income **working** year (a job change /
  sabbatical). Modeled as a list `conversionEvents: [{ id, age, amount }]` applied inside the
  accumulation walk (`runSimulation`, helper `conversion-events.js → applyConversionEvents`).
- **Taxed once** as ordinary income stacked on that year's wage floor (`netOrdinaryIncome`,
  MFJ-combined) via `stackedIncomeTax`; the conversion amount is also added to the income base
  for that year's LTCG-bracket selection (`ltcgRate(netOrdinaryIncome + conv, …)`).
- **Tax funding:** from the taxable brokerage so the full principal lands in Roth; any shortfall
  leaks from the converted dollars (Roth deposit shrinks). When that shortfall happens **under
  age 59½**, the withheld portion is an early distribution and is charged the **10% penalty**
  (`EARLY_WITHDRAWAL_AGE` 59.5 / `EARLY_WITHDRAWAL_PENALTY` 0.10). Row fields:
  `convEvent` / `convEventTax` (tax+penalty) / `convEventPenalty`.
- **Carry-forward:** the lowered trad balance flows through `tradGrossAtRet` into the retirement
  engine seed, so future RMDs drop automatically.
- **Gated** behind an in-service-eligibility toggle (`conversionInService`) — converting an active
  employer 401k while still working is plan-dependent (it requires in-service distributions; it's
  freely available from a rollover IRA after leaving a job).
- **Benefit attribution (intentional limitation):** because working-year conversions lower the
  retirement *seed* (not the retirement-window `conversionByAge`), the `noConv` counterfactual in
  `buildRetirementPhase` seeds from the already-lowered balance — so their benefit shows up as
  **longer longevity and a lower `rmdTaxBite`**, NOT in the conversion-*window* `netConversionBenefit`
  headline. The UI says so; the optimizer is scoped to retirement-window conversions so it never
  claims a benefit it can't measure.

### Bracket Fill Strategy
- Target bracket top (12%, 22%, or 24%) + standard deduction − retirement income floor
- Retirement income floor = 85% of householdSS + effectivePension (steady-state, for display and bracket-fill suggestion)
- **Per-year floors for tax calculation:** `buildIncomeFloors({ startAge, … })` (anchored to the
  resolved window start) produces a `retIncomeFloors[]` array where each entry reflects whether SS
  and pension have actually started in that year. Pre-SS/pre-pension years use a lower floor, so the
  marginal rate on conversions in those years is computed correctly.

### Dual Tax Source Scenarios
- **From converted amount**: Roth receives (conversion − tax), less efficient
- **From taxable brokerage**: Roth receives full conversion, tax paid from taxable account
- Both scenarios computed simultaneously; user selects which to display

### Optimizer (timing + amount)
- `findOptimalConversionPlan` (`roth-conversion.js`) searches BOTH the conversion-window **start
  age** and the flat annual **amount** that maximize net benefit after IRMAA/ACA, via the SAME
  engine + `evaluateConversionPlan` the screen uses (so it can never search a different model —
  BUG-31/BUG-35 class). The suggestion line shows the recommended start age and amount. Start-age
  search granularity is `ASSUMPTIONS.CONVERSION_STARTAGE_STEP` (1 yr); amount step is
  `ASSUMPTIONS.CONVERSION_STEP` ($5k). Only runs in custom (flat-amount) mode.

## Drawdown Model

### Net Portfolio Need
```
netPortfolioNeed = max(0, effectiveExpenses − householdSS − effectivePension)
```
This is the only value used for portfolio depletion. The portfolio does NOT fund the full expense — SS and pension are external income.

**Critical: per-year computation in loops.** The static scalar `netPortfolioNeed` is correct only when all income sources are active. Any loop spanning retirement years must compute the need per-year:
```
yearSS      = includeSS && age >= ssClaimingAge ? householdSS : 0
yearPension = pensionMonthly > 0 && age >= pensionStartAge ? pensionMonthly × 12 : 0
yearNeed    = max(0, effectiveExpenses − yearSS − yearPension)
```
This applies to: `totalChartData` drawdown loop, `convWindowDraws` in `flowData`, and `retIncomeFloors[]` passed to `calcConversionSim`. The static scalar is still used for `withdrawalRate` and at-retirement display snapshots — those use the steady-state (all sources active) value, which is the correct "at retirement" snapshot. `yearsSustained` uses the per-year walk (`buildRetirementDrawdown`), not this scalar.

### Real Return
```
rReal = (1 + nominalReturn) / (1 + inflation) − 1
```

### Years Sustained — the one tax-honest walk (`buildRetirementDrawdown`)
The retirement portfolio is walked in exactly **one** place, `buildRetirementDrawdown`
(`src/model/retirement-drawdown.js`), consumed by the chart, the headline
`yearsSustained`, the Flow-Down waterfall (`calcFlowDown`), `calcDrawdownYears`, and
the optimizer. The per-year recurrence is:
```
draw    = max(0, effectiveExpenses − yearSS − yearPension)   // SS/pension gated per-year
tax     = rmdTaxByAge[age] + conversionTaxByAge[age]         // 0 where absent
balEnd  = balStart*(1 + rReal) − draw − tax
```
`yearsSustained` = years until `balEnd ≤ 0` (fractional in the depletion year), or
Infinity if the portfolio survives the horizon.

**Why tax is subtracted (the gross-up).** To *spend* `draw` net, the retiree must
withdraw enough to also pay that year's income tax, so the tax is a real leak out of
the pool. The closed-form `calcYearsSustained` (kept only as a tax-free reference)
cannot represent a time-varying per-year tax and netted SS for every year regardless
of claiming age, so it overstated longevity — see BUG-31.

**Single-pool assumptions (documented):**
- One combined pool grown at one real rate; no per-account tax-treatment split during
  drawdown (Roth/taxable/trad growth all at `rReal`).
- Only the **tax** leaks. The RMD/conversion *principal* is not a separate outflow —
  whether spent or reinvested it stays in the pool and keeps compounding (so it is
  never double-charged).
- RMD tax is computed in nominal dollars (matching the displayed `rmdTaxBite` and the
  waterfall's RMD-tax bar) so the chart, longevity, and waterfall reconcile to the
  same tax figure.

The old closed form (kept for reference / the tax-free estimate):
```
if netPortfolioNeed ≤ 0 or portfolio × rReal ≥ netPortfolioNeed → Infinity
else → log(1 − (portfolio × rReal / netPortfolioNeed)) / log(1 / (1 + rReal))
```

### Withdrawal Rate
```
withdrawalRate = netPortfolioNeed / totalAtRet × 100
```
Uses net need, not gross expenses. A 3.5% rate means the portfolio funds 3.5% of itself, with SS/pension covering the rest.

## Modeling Assumptions (`ASSUMPTIONS` constant)

Non-statutory factors used throughout the model live in the `ASSUMPTIONS`
object in `src/config/irs-2026.js` — never hardcoded at call sites (rule #1).
These are modeling choices, not IRS limits, but they are centralized for the
same reason: one update point, no magic numbers scattered across the code.

| Constant | Value | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `SS_TAXABLE_PCT` | 0.85 | Share of SS benefit treated as taxable income in bracket-fill math |
| `MONTHS_PER_YEAR` | 12 | Monthly → annual conversions (SS, pension) |
| `SPOUSAL_BENEFIT_PCT` | 0.5 | Spousal benefit = 50% of primary PIA |
| `PIA_FACTOR_1/2/3` | 0.90 / 0.32 / 0.15 | PIA bend-point replacement rates |
| `LTCG_DRAG_PROXY` | 0.15 | Annual taxable-brokerage drag proxy (`r × (1 − 0.15)`) |
| `CONVERSION_STEP` | 5_000 | Amount-search step for the Roth-conversion optimizer |
| `CONVERSION_STARTAGE_STEP` | 1 | Start-age-search granularity (years) for the timing+amount optimizer |

> Note: `EARLY_WITHDRAWAL_AGE` (59.5) and `EARLY_WITHDRAWAL_PENALTY` (0.10) are **statutory** (the 10% early-distribution penalty), so they live with the IRS constants in `irs-2026.js`, not in `ASSUMPTIONS`.

## Known Simplifications

These are intentional modeling choices, not bugs. Document them so users and reviewers understand the tradeoffs.

| Simplification | Impact | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2026 tax rules frozen for all projection years | Medium | Real brackets adjust for inflation annually. A 30-year-old's projection uses 2026 brackets through age 90. |
| Taxable brokerage assumes annual realization | Understates taxable growth by 15–25% over 30 years | Buy-and-hold investors compound unrealized gains tax-free. The model applies LTCG drag every year. |
| 401k after-tax display uses phase rate, not effective rate | Makes 401k look worse vs Roth | Someone withdrawing $80K pays ~13% effective, not the 22% phase rate. |
| State tax uses flat effective rate during accumulation | Inaccurate at income extremes | A $50K CA earner pays ~4%, not the table's 9.3%. User can override with the slider. |
| State retirement income exemptions not modeled | Overstates retirement state tax for most states | 13 states exempt SS; many exempt pension/401k. Feature #33 (bracket-accurate retirement tax) is done; structured per-source exemption flags are the remaining gap — planned as feature #52. |
| Inflation applied to returns but not to brackets/limits | Subtle asymmetry | IRS adjusts limits annually. Sim uses 2026 limits with inflation-adjusted returns. |
| SS benefit assumes continuous work to retirement | Overstates SS for anyone with career gaps | Retiring at 45 leaves fewer high-earning years in the 35-year average. Work-gap input planned: feature #11. |
| Income growth compounds indefinitely without a user-set plateau | Overstates contribution capacity and SS AIME for long projections | A $100k earner at 3%/yr reaches $289k by 65. Users can cap this with the "Income plateau age" slider; `incomeGrowthEndAge` passed to both `runSimulation` and `calcAIME`. Default null = no cap. |
| Spouse 401k/Roth/HSA accounts not modeled | Understates household contribution capacity for dual-income MFJ | Spouse accounts tracked as planned premium feature #30. Current sliders are primary earner only. |
| Working-year conversion benefit not shown in the window headline | The `netConversionBenefit` figure ignores pre-retirement (working-year) conversions | These conversions lower the retirement *seed*, so the `noConv` counterfactual seeds from the already-lowered balance. Their real benefit appears in longevity / lower `rmdTaxBite`, not the conversion-window figure. Quantifying it would need a third counterfactual — deferred. UI states this; optimizer is scoped to window conversions. |
| Duration-event income during the event is taxed on the **engine** path but not in the blended what-if delta walk | Slightly understates tax in *comparative* overlays only | **Resolved on the headline path (2026-07-20).** `applyMoneyEvents` adds `eventIncomeForYear` to `taxableIncomeAdjustment`, and the per-account engine (`buildRetirementWalkByAccount`) taxes it as ordinary income stacked on the SS/pension floor (`inflowTax`) — so chart / longevity / Flow-Down / RMD numbers are tax-honest for retirement-phase event income. The blended `buildRetirementDrawdown` (used only by `calcWhatIfDelta` / `calcOptimizedScenario`) consumes `eventNetForYear` directly and still doesn't charge it — the remaining BUG-36 residual. |
| Single fixed return rate for full projection | Ignores sequence-of-returns risk | A bad decade early in retirement is far worse than the same average return. Monte Carlo planned: feature #38. |

## IRS Annual Update Procedure

When the IRS publishes new limits (typically October for the following year):

1. **Update `src/config/irs-2026.js`** — rename to `irs-2027.js`, update all values:
   - `TRAD_401K_LIMIT`, `ROTH_IRA_LIMIT`, `HSA_LIMIT`
   - `LIMIT_415C`, `LIMIT_415C_CATCHUP`
   - `FICA_WAGE_BASE`
   - Federal bracket thresholds (all 4 filing statuses)
   - Standard deductions (all 4 filing statuses)
   - LTCG bracket thresholds
   - Roth IRA MAGI phase-out thresholds
   - SS bend points (if updated)
   - Catch-up contribution amounts

2. **Update import path** in any file that imports the config

3. **Run all tests** — any test using hardcoded expected values may need updating

4. **Update the "2026 Tax Year" badge** in the UI header

All IRS-specific values must trace back to the single config file. If `grep -r "24_500\|24500" src/` finds hits outside the config, something was hardcoded.

## Correctness Fix Log

A record of bugs found and fixed in the financial model (not feature additions — these were wrong answers).

| Date | Bug | Fix | Affected calculations |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jun 2026 | SS and pension subtracted from portfolio draws before they start | Per-year `netPortfolioNeed` in `totalChartData` loop, `convWindowDraws`, and `retIncomeFloors[]` to `calcConversionSim` | Drawdown chart, conversion window tax, Flow-Down waterfall |
| Jun 2026 | Pension not counted in drawdown when `pensionStartAge > safeRetAge` | Same per-year fix — check `age >= pensionStartAge` in all drawdown loops | `yearsSustained` for deferred-pension users |
| Jun 2026 | Spouse FICA not included in household taxes | `fica = (min(p, FICA_WAGE_BASE) + min(s, FICA_WAGE_BASE)) × 0.0765` | `takeHome`, `grossAfterTax`, `savingsCapacity` |
| Jun 2026 | MFJ spouse income missing from AGI, state tax, and budget | `agi` and `grossAfterTax` now use `householdIncome` when `filingStatus === "mfj"` | Federal tax, state tax, `savingsCapacity`, `optimizedAllocation` |
| Jun 24 2026 | Working-year conversion didn't bump that year's LTCG bracket (cap-gains rate picked before the conversion) | Compute the capped `conv` before the `ltcgRate` call; pass `ltcgRate(netOrdinaryIncome + conv, …)` (`simulation.js`). Inert when no events → golden-master-safe | Taxable-account growth in a working-conversion year, and downstream retirement balances |
| Jun 24 2026 | What-if overlay re-sim dropped permanent working-year conversions, diverging the overlay baseline from the main plan (BUG-34 class) | Thread `conversionEvents` + `stateRate` through `whatIfSimInputs` so the re-sim sees the same events | What-if scenario baseline arc/longevity |
| Jun 24 2026 | Phantom 1-year conversion window when retiring at/after 72 (clamp collapsed to age 72 with `conversionWindowYrs = 1`) | `hasConvWindow` guard so the window is genuinely empty (`conversionWindowYrs = 0`) when `safeRetAge ≥ RMD_START_AGE−1` | Conversion section visibility, "window closes" arc marker (now `resolvedEndAge`) |
| Jul 13 2026 | Duration events modeled only cash outflow, ignored lost income — sabbaticals charged only trip spend, not suppressed salary/401k/match/MAGI/AIME (BUG-72) | Two-channel semantics: `eventAmountForYear` (event cash) + `eventIncomeForYear` (prorated income for duration outflows). Working-year loop now uses `eventsIncomeAdjustment` to suppress `primaryIncomeYr`, scale contributions by `incomeFrac`, and suppress MAGI/Roth phase-out. Boundary-spanning events split by `eventFirstAge`/`eventLastAge` helpers (each month counted exactly once). Retirement walks unchanged (untaxed per BUG-36 scope). | Life-event verdict accuracy, working-year contribution capacity, MAGI / Roth phase-out, SS AIME (≤ 1% for 3-yr pause) |
| Jul 13 2026 | Verdict saturated to "comfortable" for any non-depleting plan, no margin context — user can't distinguish $10k vs $100k buffer at age 90 (BUG-73) | `marginForScenario` computes cushion basis = balance-at-90 / annual-expenses (years of runway), gated on depletion binary. `verdictInfoForScenario` returns verdict (3-state) + labeled ranges ("5+ yrs = comfortable") from `EVENT_COMFORT_BUFFER_YEARS` constant. Verdict tick rails and life-event cards now render margin context alongside verdict. | Life-event verdict card, plan/dial preview display, LifeEventSheet duration-month rail, Ideas scenario comparison |
| Jul 13 2026 | Accumulation event spend beyond the taxable balance was silently forgiven — `Math.max(0, …)` clamp meant a $540k trip against a small brokerage charged only the brokerage; tripling a trip's spend barely moved the impact (BUG-74, user-reported) | Funding cascade, all on PRE-growth balances (one timing convention): taxable → Roth (grossed up for the 10% early-withdrawal penalty under 59½; basis untracked, no ordinary tax on the Roth portion) → Traditional 401k grossed up (stacked ordinary tax + 10% early-withdrawal penalty under 59½, fixed-point solve); 401k draw joins the LTCG-bracket stack; HSA never touched. Residual = `eventShortfall` per row → `eventFundingShortfall` on what-if scenarios → shared `verdictForScenarioResult` forces "unaffordable" ("$X can't be funded from savings") and caps at "tight" whenever ANY early retirement-account withdrawal was needed (`eventRetirementDraw`), even if the walk still looks healthy afterward. Cushion labels cap at `CUSHION_LABEL_CAP_YEARS` (50) for SS-covered plans; balance-delta bullets phrase the change ("decreases/increases by $X") instead of a signed number. | Every accumulation-phase event's true cost (spend + funding taxes/penalties now actually leave the portfolio), life-event verdicts, Year-by-year ledger draw/tax columns, at-65/at-90 impact bullets |
| Jul 13 2026 | Sabbatical/leave income restart used the UNPAUSED age clock — a $100k salary paused 3 years resumed at ~$120k instead of the ~$103k it left off at (owner spec, PR #54 review) | `runSimulation`'s salary now advances a pause-aware growth CLOCK by `incomeFrac` per year (frozen during a full pause, unaffected by the seeded full-pay default) instead of the raw `age − currentAge` offset; `projectedIncomeAtAge` (UI seed / `eventIncomeImpact` baseline) stays the no-event closed form, identical to the clock when no events exist | Post-sabbatical salary trajectory, working-year contributions/MAGI in the years after a pause, new `salary` sim-row field |
| Jul 20 2026 | Retirement-phase duration-event income (part-time work etc.) was received tax-free in the headline walk (BUG-36 strand) | `applyMoneyEvents` now folds every event's prorated `eventIncomeForYear` into `taxableIncomeAdjustment`; the per-account engine taxes it once as ordinary income stacked on the SS/pension floor (`inflowTax`). Engine-only, so the blended what-if delta walk is unaffected (remaining BUG-36 residual). Inert with no events → golden master untouched | Retirement-phase tax, longevity, chart, Flow-Down for users with retirement event income |

## Money Events — duration escalation & open-ended spans (2026-07-20 extension)

Money events (`src/model/money-events.js`) are the canonical dated-money store. Beyond the
one-time and fixed-length duration events already documented, a duration event may carry two
optional fields. Both default to absent, and an event without them is **byte-identical** to a
legacy event (the golden master depends on this):

- **`growthPct`** — annual escalation percent applied to both the monthly-spend term and the
  `incomeAnnual` term. The factor is `(1 + growthPct/100)^k`, where `k` is the whole-year offset
  from the event's start age (`k = age − ev.age`, `k ≤ 0 → 1×`), via the module-internal
  `growthFactorForAge`. `eventGrossCost` sums per active year so escalation is reflected in the
  total. One-time events ignore it. Because the escalation lives inside `eventAmountForYear` /
  `eventIncomeForYear` (the shared per-year helpers), every walk — accumulation sim, per-account
  engine, blended what-if — inherits it automatically.
- **`untilAge`** — an open-ended alternative to `durationMonths`: the event runs *through* the year
  the person turns `untilAge` (inclusive), resolved to a month count by the module-internal
  `spanMonths` as `(untilAge − age + 1) × 12`. When both `untilAge` and `durationMonths` are
  present, **`untilAge` wins**. `untilAge < age` degenerates to a zero-month (non-duration) event.
  This makes an **expense step-down** expressible ("extra spend until a payoff/step-down age, then
  it stops") and "rest of plan" (set `untilAge` to the plan horizon). No clamp is needed in the
  module — each walk stops at its own `endAge`, so an open-ended event is naturally bounded by the
  plan horizon.

**Start-age floor.** Events cannot start at exactly `currentAge`: `runSimulation`'s accumulation
rows begin at `currentAge + 1`, so an event dated at `currentAge` would be silently dropped by the
accumulation walk. `lifeEventBounds.minAge` (App.jsx) is therefore `currentAge + 1` by design.

**Presets** exercising the open-ended mechanism: "Mortgage paid off" (the freed-up cash AFTER
payoff, an inflow from the payoff age through the plan — the living-expenses baseline already
contains the mortgage payment, so a pre-payoff outflow event would double-count it; coordinator
review fix 2026-07-20) and "Higher early-retirement spend" (go-go-years delta above baseline that
steps down at a chosen age — a delta, so it never overlaps the baseline).
